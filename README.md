# Car-Detection-and-Counting-using-YOLO-CVZone-contest

In this project i used YOLO V3 model trained on custom dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13H6npAapD5j2NfAX5Xnr42Y1Wed1PMy7?usp=sharing
for detecting the cars.
The weights for the custom trained YOLO V3 model is : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8r2I98zl1-Pq_nvh0MmSQs18iictaQr/view?usp=sharing
These weights are only trained on one class (Car) only.
